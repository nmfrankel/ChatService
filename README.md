## What I learned from V2
-	Developed a REST API with role based access control (RBAC) using (**Express.js**)[https://expressjs.com/].
-	Created tables and interacted with (**Prisma ORM**)[https://prisma.io/] to a cloud hosted database.
-	Utilized (**Svelte-kit**)[https://kit.svelte.dev/] with and (**TypeScript**)[https://www.typescriptlang.org/] for the user interface.
-	Implemented CI/CD practices triggered by each code push to (**Github**)[https://github.com/].
